# Movie Trailer Website

Simple dynamic website that shows a bunch movies and trailers. <br>
The home page shows my six favourite movies, other pages are self explanatory.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, rename "tmdbapi/sample-config.py" to "tmdbapi/config.py" and fill in your TMDB API key.
2. Open your dev console to the root of this project and run <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Start the program by typing ```python run.py```, your browser should open pointing to 127.0.0.1:5000 showing the home page.

## For Udacity reviewer
Inside the zip file uploaded there's already a compiled config.pyc file, so please skip the first step of the previous paragraph.

### Note
If for any reason your port 5000 is already taken feel free to change it. <br>
Inside "run.py" there are 2 occurences, make sure they match.
