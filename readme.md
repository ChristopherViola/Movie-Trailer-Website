# Movie Trailer Website

Simple dynamic website that shows a bunch movies and trailers. <br>
The home page shows my six favourite movies, other pages are self explanatory.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, rename ".sample.env" to ".env" and fill in your TMDB API key.
2. Open your dev console to the root of this project and run <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Start the program by typing ```python run.py```, your browser should open pointing to 127.0.0.1:5000 showing the home page.

### Notes
If for any reason your port 5000 is already taken feel free to change it. <br>
Inside "run.py" there are 2 occurences, make sure they match.
